			Inspired by Morah Miriam Adler A”H’s dedication to chessed, TAG Alumnae gathered in TAG High School on September 22 to launch The Miriam Kayla Alumnae Initiative. Following the powerful words of Rabbi Hirtz, brother of Morah Adler, the details of the program were introduced through a short video and elaborated upon by an alumna. The event culminated with the packaging of Rosh Hashanah, spa-themed packages to pamper single mothers in the community before Yom Tov.
